## Idea
This app is aiming to help you find nerby events super easy and in a minimal way in order to make your life easier.
## How to use
EventIFind is very easy to use, all you have to do is just to look on the map for an event, that you like and want to go, and tap that JOIN button.</br>
After that you are good to go.
